# Pre-Thesis: Predicting Student Academic Performance Using Machine Learning

This repository implements and extends the experiments from the Springer paper  
**"Predicting Student Academic Performance Using Machine Learning Techniques" (2025)**.  
The goal is to reproduce, compare, and improve model performance on educational datasets.

## Overview

| Model | Description | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **GLR (Linear Regression)** | Baseline statistical model | Benchmark for comparison |
| **Decision Tree** | Interpretable non-linear model | Explore rule-based predictions |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble method | Achieve higher predictive accuracy |

Workflow: **Data preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE, MSE) → Comparison with paper results**
